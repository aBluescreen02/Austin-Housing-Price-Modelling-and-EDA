## Overview  
This project explores and models housing prices in Austin using a real estate dataset. The workflow includes:  

- **Data Cleaning**: Removed irrelevant variables, corrected false records, and converted categorical features.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Univariate, bivariate, and geographic visualizations to uncover patterns and insights.  
- **Modeling & Comparison**: Trained and evaluated models including **LASSO**, **GLM**, and **XGBoost** to predict housing prices.  

## Dataset  
- **Source**: Public Austin real estate listings dataset from Zillow.  
- **Size**: ~15,000 observations after cleaning.  
- **Features**: Includes home characteristics (e.g., square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, lot size), location data, and listing information.  

## Repository Contents  
- `austin-housing-eda-price-modelling.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter Notebook containing full workflow.  
- Scripts and functions for cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling.  

## Goal  
To analyze the Austin housing market and build predictive models that highlight the key drivers of property valuations.
